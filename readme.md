# GSWAT NodeJS

### Recommended IDE

It is recommended to use an IntelliJ idea, doesn't matter which flavor: http://www.jetbrains.com/products.html

### Installation


* Install Node.js - http://nodejs.org/
* Navigate to the gswat-node directory in a shell and run `npm install` to grab the dependencies.
* In the node window, type in: `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* Start gswat-node by running `node server`

To avoid conflicts gswat-node runs on Port 3000 by default, you can change this in the app.js file or by setting a PORT property for your corresponding environment in the config/config.js file.
